# excel-to-tally-xml
This Python script converts Excel files into Tally-compatible XML for Sales or Receipt vouchers. It reads amounts, parties, narration, and charges, formats them properly, and generates ready-to-import XML files. I built this tool for my father to simplify and automate his accounting workflow.
